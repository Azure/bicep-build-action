# ðŸ’ª Bicep Build Action [![Build](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-build-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-build-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

GitHub Action that builds a [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/EN-US/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) main file and outputs a generated ARM Template file.

## When to use

The action is particularly useful for Continuous Integration scenarios where you want to validate the ARM template further on your workflow and/or publish it as an artifact.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If your GitHub Actions workflows are running on a [self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners):

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#azure-cli) 2.20.0 or later installed
- File write permission on the runner as this action creates an ARM template file dynamically.

### Usage

```yml
steps:
  - name: Bicep Build
    uses: Azure-Samples/bicep-build-action@v1.0.0
    with:
      bicepFilePath: main.bicep
      outputFilePath: azuredeploy.json
```

### Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bicepFilePath` | Bicep main file path | false | `./main.bicep` |
| `outputFilePath` | Path where the ARM template file will be created | false | `./azuredeploy.json` |  ARM |
